## Overview of the School District Analysis

The School District Analysis has been done to analyze the academic performance in core classes (math and reading) across 15 high schools in the district. The data obtained is important for the local Department of Education and school board members in making decisions regarding each individual school funding as well as for the implementation of additional remediation programs districtwide. 

Due to the evidence of academic dishonesty, the reading and math scores for 9th graders in Thomas High School have been nulled.
