# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of the School District Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of the current project is to analyze the school district data based on the academic performance in two core areas (math and reading), budget, school size and type across 15 high schools in the district. The outcomes of the data correlation among above listed categories are important for the local Department of Education and school board members in making decisions regarding each individual school funding as well as for the implementation/facilitation of any additional remediation/support programs districtwide.
Due to the evidence of academic dishonesty, the reading and math scores for 9th graders in Thomas High School have been nulled, and the school district data analysis was repeated to preserve academic integrity. 

# Results

## How is the district summary affected?

There was an insignificant decrease of less than 1% in average reading/math scores and overall passing percentage, when the scores were nulled for 9th graders in THS in the district’s summary. Thus, it is safe to assume that removing the scores of 461 9th graders from a pool of 40,000 students did not affect the overall district results. 

Initial Analysis:

Repeated Analysis:

## How is the school summary affected?

Based on the original analysis of the school data, Thomas HS had 93% and 97% passing rates in math and reading, respectively. Overall passing percentage was at 91%. The removal of 9th grade math and reading scores in THS caused a significant decrease in overall academic readiness for this school (65%, a decrease of 26% from the original results), with 67% in math and 70% in reading. It should be noted that average math and reading scores remained unchanged. Removing a portion of scores from THS did not affect the scores for the other high schools in the district, thus, the numbers remained the same.

Repeated Analysis:

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas HS ranked 2nd among the highest performing schools in the district upon completion of the initial analysis. However, when 9th grade scores in reading and math were nulled for Thomas HS, and the data was ran again, the overall passing percentage decreased significantly and Thomas HS dropped to the 8th place. 


## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	
  1. Math and reading scores for grades other than 9th were not affected at all in THS.The scores for 9th graders in THS were converted to Nan and not          included in the repeated analysis, thus, no affect on overall data.
  2. Scores by school spending, size and/or type had a minimal, statistically insignificant change upon repeated analysis. 

# Summary

  1. The percentage of the students passing math dropped from 93% to 67% in THS when 9th grade scores were nulled.
  2. The percentage of the students passing reading dropped from 97% to 69% in THS when 9th grade scores were nulled.
  3. The overall passing percentage dropped from 91% to 61% in THS when 9th grade scores were nulled.
  4. THS rating dropped from 2nd to 8th place among 15 High Schools in the district. 
  5. There was no significant change in average scores for THS when 9th grade scores for math and reading were nulled. The removal of scores had no affect      on grade data in the rest of high schools and no affect on school budget, size and type.
